# Linear_Structure_ADT
Project completed in CS122 Data Structures


In this project, I explored the relationship between an array-based and a linked-list based implementation of a "linear structure" ADT. In the array-based class, I wrote the methods that form the interface for the linear structure along with a constructor and a destructor and many private methods to increase or decrease the capacity of the array. The public methods included addToStart(int value) that adds the given value to the beginning of the structure, addToIndex(int value, int index) that adds the given value to the given position in the structure, removeFromStart() that removes the element at the beginning of the structure, and returns it, removeFromIndex(int index) that removes the element at the given position, and returns it, getSize() that returns the size of the structure, get(int index) that returns the element at the given index and printAll() that prints each element in the structure in order. In the linked-list class, I coded a constructor and a destructor, along with all the same public methods that I mentioned above. Creating these two separate classes in C++, made me conclude that it is easy to fast index in arrays but adding and removing process is very slow. In the case of linked-lists, however, it is difficult to index, but adding and removing process is fast.
